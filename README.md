# File Indexer
 This is my second course work. The purpose of the program is to create a file indexer which contains list with files on the computer for faster and easier search 
 The program starts with the function create_array which opens a binary file, reads the information and stores it in dynamic array.
 After that the user can choose between 4 options: searching a file(1), adding a file(2), writting the information about directory(3) and save and exit(0).
